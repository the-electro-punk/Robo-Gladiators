# Robot-Gladiators

# Description

This was meant to be code for a simple battle game where the player decides to attack the enemy of skip the fight. I used Javascript to code the battle as it is the main program for coding such complex designs; as this was my first time coding somthing like this, I used basic window prompts and type-input based actions. As this was my first time coding a game, I struggled to create a true gaming experience as after each opponent attacks once, the game just ends. Now that I am more knowledgable about coding, I'm confident I can create a truly working battle system.

# How to run the project

Open the index file and simply run the webpage (alt + B) to get the game up and running. All you'll see is a blank screen and a window prompt. Type in either FIGHT to begin the battle or SKIP to avoid it (note: due to it's incomplete nature, the battle just ends after each opponent attacks once)

# Credits

While I was the sole person working most of these assignments, I usually received help from classmates, instructors, and online tutorials for help better understanding certain concepts
